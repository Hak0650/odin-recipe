<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>For The Yoghurt Base</h3>
  <ol>
     <li>Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius.</li>
     <li>Prick your aubergines a few times all around, 
         place them on a baking tray and then place them on the middle shelf of the oven.</li>
     <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes until the skin is 
         charring and the the flesh inside is soft.
    </li>
     <li>Meanwhile, add your yoghurt, olive oil and garlic to a bowl and mix until 
         smooth. Leave to stand at room temperature.</li>
     <li>When your aubergines are baked, 
         remove from the oven and place on a plate to cool.</li>
     <li>Turn your oven off but keep 
         he door closed so the oven stays warm inside.</li>
     <li>When your aubergines are cool enough to touch after about ten minutes, pull the 
         skin away and then roughly chop the flesh.</li>
     <li>Add the lemon juice to the pulp and mix.</li>
     <li>Now stir the aubergine into your yoghurt.</li>
     <li>Place the yoghurt and aubergine mix into your slightly warm oven along with two 
         plates and turn your attention to your meat topping.</li>
    
    </ol>
    <h3>For The Lamb Topping</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your butter and oil in a frying pan 
            on a medium heat and add your onion.</li>
        <li>Sauté for 5 minutes until it starts to go translucent and 
            then add your peppers, including the chilli.</li>
        <li>Saute for a couple of minutes before 
            adding your lamb mince and your spices.</li>
        <li>Stir your mix around and when your meat is starting to brown and 
            release its juices, mix in your salça (tomato paste).</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to season and cook on a medium heat, breaking up any bigger clumps of mince.
        </li>
        <li>Once your meat is cooked (about 10 minutes), remove from the heat.</li>

    </ol>
