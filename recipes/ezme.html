<h2>Description</h2>
<p>AIt’s basically a spicy tomato salad dip. The nearest thing we can think of to describe
     it to you is a hot salsa dip made with the freshest of ingredients.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>3 large ripe beef tomatoes</li>
   <li>5 fresh chillies</li>
   <li>1 large red capsicum pepper seeds removed</li>
   <li>1 medium cucumber quartered lengthwise & centre removed</li>
   <li>1 large onion peeled</li>
   <li>½ bunch parsley</li>
   <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
   <li>1 tbsp vinegar</li>
   <li>1 tbsp tomato puree</li>
   <li>1 tsp dried mint</li>
   <li>salt for seasoning</li>
  </ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
     <li>Place a pan of 
         water on the hob and bring to the boil.</li>
     <li>Plunge your tomatoes into the water for just under 1 minute and 
         then remove them and place in cold water.</li>
     <li>Now remove the skin from the tomatoes – it should peel 
         away easily because of the boiling water.</li>
     <li>Cut your tomatoes in half, scoop out the seeds 
         with a teaspoon and discard the seeds.</li>
     <li>Chop your tomatoes as finely as you can without them turning 
         to pulp and add them to a large bowl.</li>
     <li>Now chop the onion, pepper, chillies and cucumber as finely 
         as you can and add those to the tomatoes.</li>
     <li>
        Remove the stalks from your parsley and finely chop this before 
        adding that to your other ingredients.
     </li>
     <li>Now add the mint, oil, 
         vinegar, tomato puree and salt.</li>
     <li>Give everything a good mix and do a taste test.</li>
     <li>Add more chillies if necessary (Antep ezmesi is supposed to be spicy) and, if it seems too loose,
         add more salça (tomato puree), too.</li>
     <li>Place in the fridge 
         for at least one hour before serving.</li>
    </ol>
